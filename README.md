This project was started as one of my passion project for the summer break as I had nothing better to do.


Realising that I could better put up my knowledge to use with this codebase , I started this project to 

understand the working of drone simulation and avionics at its core.


Majoorly this simulation is developed in GNU Octave , an open source alternative to MATLAB , one of the 


most formidable technologies I have eveer seen. 


More ever I believe that , I would be also , at a later stage perhaps , implementing some ML algorithms


so as to see whether or not this will be constructive in actual implementation of a drone.


So this will be the basic work I intend to do . 

If you pass by and would like to suggest some improvements or collaborate or just 

anything you feel , just mail me at : sagnikc859@gmail.com


or just Pm me in the linkedin profile above .


Thanks for reading !!
